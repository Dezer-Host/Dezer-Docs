## Download Files
Begin by creating the directory where the dashboard will be installed, then navigate into the newly created folder:
```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/pterodactyl
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
```
Once the directory is ready, use FileZilla to upload and extract the dashboard files into this location.
